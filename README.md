## Buffers - Text to Speech

Create a program that converts text to MP3, using google translate. You donâ€™t need any external libraries.
It is enough to make a GET request to the google translate URL and process the binary response.

Example:  
[https://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&tl=en&client=tw-ob&q=Beware+of+heard+a+dreadful+word+that+looks+like+beard+and+sounds+like+bird](https://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&tl=en&client=tw-ob&q=Beware+of+heard+a+dreadful+word+that+looks+like+beard+and+sounds+like+bird)
